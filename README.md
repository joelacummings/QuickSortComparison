# QuickSortComparison
A comparison of languages using the quicksort algorithm for CIS\*4500.

This seeks to compare 4 langauges in their implemnentation of quicksort developed by hand. 
This compares the structures, syntax, performance and suitability of a language for the algorithim.

Each program reads in a file of integers and sorts them, outputting them to stdout.
